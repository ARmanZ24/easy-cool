/*These codes are coded in either java or python with simple logic and explanation. The codes do not essentially follow any best coding practices and doesn't designed to obey time and space complexity.*/

//Eclipse could be used to run the java file and pycharm for python or Viscual Studio Code to run the both. 
//Simply download this code and paste it in your platform and run it. Tadaaa!! You got it
//Make sure you do the neccessary changes to this code. for eg: Change the package names in the java codes and other reference variables

That's it for me. Happy Coding.
